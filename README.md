## Fish Or Boot? 

* A two-player turn-based fishing game written in Python to be played in the terminal.
* In each cell of the pond grid there is either a fish or a boot.
* Players score points by catching fish. Whoever has the most fish after the grid has been depleted wins the game!

* Two grids are used to represent the pond surface and pond life underneath, respectively 
  * The former holds data on whether each cell is a fish or boot 
  * The latter is used to show the players which cells have been visited already (prevents revisiting cells) 

# How to run the game: 
* After cloning the repo, open a terminal and navigate to the directory 
* Then use the following command: python3 main.py 
* The game will run and display the relevant prompts
